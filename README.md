# ‚ñ∂ Clean Tube 
Cleaner YouTube Clone ‚ñ∂Ô∏è with no ads using Youtube-DL 

üöß This project is under-construction üöß

#### Why I'm building this ? 
Youtube recently increased ad frequency to the everest and I'm sick of it. I understand that creators need to be supported but for me it looks like youtube is forcing people to buy their premium membership. To get that happen they flood us with multiple ads.

Note : We're building this for personal use not to distribute it.

### Set Up
Firstly, Download the source as zip or just use 

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/kamaravichow/clean-tube.git
```

to download the source to your computer

I recommend to use Pycharm you can go with any editor.

open the terminal and execute following  (windows)
```shell script
set FLASK_APP=app.py
```
This will set the flask app to app.py so you can run it locally on your computer

```shell script
flask run
```
This will start the app locally on your pc.

It should output something like :
```shell script
* Serving Flask app "app.py"
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

```

This means your local app is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/, Just open that in the browser.
